# CuriousNetwork
This project aims to implements a "curiosity mecanism" for a robot. The goal is to generate an error signal using an
auto encoder and a convolutionnal network. That error signal is generated by something that the model hasn't seen
before, thus triggering "curiosity" in the model, and eventually allowing a robot to focus
its attention on such new elements of its environment. It runs on python 3.
