# CuriousNetwork
This project aims to implements a "curiosity mecanism" for a robot. The goal is to generate an error signal using an
autoencoder and a convolutionnal network. That error signal is generated by something that the model hasn't seen
before, thus triggering "curiosity" in the model, and eventually allowing a robot to focus
its attention on such new elements of its environment. It runs on python 3.

## Database
The database for thir project is composed of images from a tunnel and a corridor from the Universit√© de Sherbrooke. In the training set, the walls are free
from any elements, and in the test set the walls have different types of elements on them, which should generate a decoding error, and thus a "curiosity" signal. The dataset can be downloaded using the following command:
```bash
source get_dataset.sh
```
